"IC.BUS.EASE.XQ      ","","Ease of doing business index (1=easiest to 183=most difficult)","","Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1 (easiest) to 183 (most difficult). A good (low) score on the ease of doing business index means the regulatory environment is conducive to the operation of business. This index averages the country's percentile rankings on 10 topics, made up of a variety of indicators, giving equal weight to each topic. The 2009 rankings are from Doing Business 2010: Reforming through Difficult Times, covering the period June 2008 through May 2009.","","","","","","","","","World Bank, Doing Business Project (http://www.doingbusiness.org/economyranking)","","","","","","",
"IC.CRD.INFO.XQ      ","","Depth of credit information index (0=low to 6=high)","","The depth of credit information index measures rules affecting the scope, accessibility, and quality of credit information available through either public or private credit registries. The index ranges from 0 to 6, with higher values indicating the availability of more credit information to facilitate lending decisions. Specifically, a score of 0 indicates that the registry is not operational or that it covers less than 0.1% of the adult population. At the other end of the scale, a score of 6 indicates that regulations guarantee borrowers the right to access their data in the largest registry in the economy and that the following information is distributed as part of a report: (1) both positive and negative credit information; (2) data on both firms and individuals; (3) data from retailers and utility companies; (4) more than 2 years of historical data; and (5) data on loans below 1% of income per capita.

"IC.CRD.PRVT.ZS      ","","Private credit bureau coverage (% of adults)","","To help gauge the scope and accessibility of credit information, this indicator reports the coverage of individuals and firms by a private credit bureau with information on their repayment history, unpaid debts, or credit outstanding from the past 5 years—expressed as a percentage of the adult population. A private credit bureau is defined as a private firm or nonprofit organization that maintains a database on the creditworthiness of borrowers (persons or businesses) in the financial system and facilitates the exchange of credit information among banks and financial institutions. If no private bureau operates, the coverage value is 0.  ","","","","","","","","","World Bank, Doing Business Project (http://www.doingbusiness.org/ExploreTopics/GettingCredit)","","","","","","",
"IC.CRD.PUBL.ZS      ","","Public credit registry coverage (% of adults)","","To help gauge the scope and accessibility of credit information, this indicator reports the coverage of individuals and firms by a public credit registry with information on their repayment history, unpaid debts, or credit outstanding from the past 5 years—expressed as a percentage of the adult population. A public credit registry is defined as a database managed by the public sector, usually by the central bank or the superintendent of banks, which collects information on the creditworthiness of borrowers (persons or businesses) in the financial system and makes it available to financial institutions. If no public registry operates, the coverage value is 0.  ","","","","","","","","","World Bank, Doing Business Project (http://www.doingbusiness.org/ExploreTopics/GettingCredit)","","","","","","",
"IC.GE.NUM           ","","Procedures required to connect to electricity (number)","","This indicator records the number of procedures required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection and supply for a warehouse. To ensure that data are comparable across economies, a standard case study in which an entrepreneur seeks to connect a newly built warehouse for cold meat storage to electricity was used. Data are collected from the electricity distribution utility, then completed and verified by independent professionals such as electricians, electrical engineers, electrical contractors, and construction companies.

"IC.ISV.DURS         ","","Time to resolve insolvency (years)","","The time (in calendar years) required by bankruptcy proceedings involving domestic entities is measured—starting with the filing for insolvency in court and ending with the resolution of distressed assets. The data are derived from survey responses by local insolvency practitioners and verified through a study of laws and regulations as well as public information on bankruptcy systems. Potential delay tactics by the parties, such as the filing of dilatory appeals or requests for extension, are taken into consideration. To make data comparable across countries, certain assumptions about the business and the case are used. If an economy has had fewer than 5 cases a year over the past 5 years, it receives a “no practice” mark.

"IC.LGL.CRED.XQ      ","","Credit: Strength of legal rights index (0=weak to 10=strong)","","The strength of legal rights index measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws protect the rights of borrowers and lenders and thus facilitate lending. The index ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating that laws are better designed to expand access to credit. Specifically, up to 8 points are awarded for aspects of collateral law and up to 2 points are awarded for aspects of bankruptcy law. Data is gathered through a survey of financial lawyers and then verified through analysis of laws and regulations as well as public sources of information.

"IC.REG.DURS         ","","Time required to start a business (days)","","The number of calendar days needed to complete all required procedures to legally operate a commercial or industrial firm are recorded by this indicator.  Requirements may include obtaining necessary licenses and permits as well as completing any required notifications, verifications, and inscriptions for the company and its employees with relevant authorities. The measure captures the median duration that incorporation lawyers indicate is necessary to complete each procedure.  If a procedure can be speeded up at additional cost, the fastest procedure, independent of cost, is chosen.

"IC.REG.PROC         ","","Procedures required to start a business (number)","","The number of procedures required to legally operate a commercial or industrial firm are recorded, including interactions to obtain necessary permits and licenses and to complete all inscriptions, verifications, and notifications for starting operations. Data are for limited liability companies with certain standardized characteristics in order to facilitate comparisons between economies.

"IC.TAX.DURS         ","","Time to prepare and pay taxes (hours)","","This indicator records the hours (per year) a medium-size company takes to prepare, file, and pay (or withhold) 3 major types of taxes: corporate income tax, value added or sales tax, and labor taxes, including payroll taxes and social security contributions. To make the data comparable across countries, several assumptions about the business and the taxes are used in a standardized case study.

"IC.TAX.PAYM         ","","Tax payments (number)","","This indicator records the total number of taxes and contributions paid by a medium-size business over the course of a year—including consumption taxes (value added or sales tax). The frequency of payments is recorded, but if the majority of medium-size businesses use electronic filing for a tax, it is counted as paid once a year, even if payments are more frequent. To make data comparable across countries, several assumptions about the business and the taxes are used in a standardized case study. Tax experts in each economy then compute the taxes and mandatory contributions due in their jurisdiction based on the standardized case study facts.","","","","","","","","","World Bank, Doing Business Project (http://www.doingbusiness.org/ExploreTopics/PayingTaxes)","","","","","","",
"IC.TAX.TOTL.CP.ZS   ","","Total tax rate (% of profit)","","The total tax rate measures the amount of taxes payable by medium-size businesses after accounting for deductions and exemptions, expressed as a share of commercial profits. The taxes withheld (such as sales or value added tax or personal income tax) but not paid by the company are excluded. The total tax rate is designed to provide a comprehensive measure of the cost of all the taxes a business bears. This methodology is consistent with the Total Tax Contribution framework developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
